# -Covid-19-in-India-Vaccination-Testing-Analytics-Tableau Dashboard

## 📌 Project Objective:
Covid-19 in India: Vaccination &amp; Testing Analytics Dashboard is an interactive Tableau visualization project that analyzes mock Covid-19 data across Indian states. It provides insights into vaccination progress (first vs second doses), vaccine types, testing outcomes, case trends, and demographic impacts (age/gender distribution).

## ✅ Key Highlights:
- First vs Second Dose comparison
- Vaccine type distribution (Covaxin, CoviShield, Sputnik V)
- Covid-19 trends (Confirmed, Cured, Deaths)
- ICMR Lab distribution by state
- Gender & Age-group analysis
- State-wise testing (Positive vs Negative)
  
## ⚠️ **Note**:
- This project uses a **sample CSV dataset** and **does not represent** actual Covid-19 statistics. It is built solely for learning and demonstration purposes.

## 📁 Dataset Used

- A **sample CSV file** simulating Covid-19-related data in India.
- Data fields include: State, Date, Vaccine Type, Doses, Age Group, Gender, Testing Results, etc.
-  📝 **Disclaimer**: This is **mock data** created for project demonstration only.

## ❓ Key Questions Answered (KPIs)

-  What is the total count of First vs Second doses administered?
-  Which vaccine types were administered most frequently?
-  What are the trends in Covid-19 cases, deaths, and recoveries over time?
-  Which states are most affected in terms of total deaths and confirmed cases?
-  How many tests were conducted state-wise and what were the results (Positive vs Negative)?
-  What is the age group distribution of the affected population?
-  What is the gender-wise distribution of Covid-19 cases?
-  How many ICMR Test Labs are available per state?

## 🔄 Process

1. **Data Cleaning & Structuring**
   - Cleaned sample CSV dataset.
   - Formatted data types and created calculated fields (e.g., Total Tests, % Gender Distribution).
  
2. **Data Modeling**
   - Linked and organized tables/dimensions: vaccination, testing, demographics, geography, etc.

3. **Dashboard Design**
   - Created:
     - Geo heat maps (deaths by state),
     - Bar charts (vaccination/test data),
     - Line charts (confirmed/cured/death trends),
     - Donut & pie charts (age/gender distribution).
   - Designed dark theme layout for visual emphasis.
   - Enabled interactivity using filters and parameters in Tableau.


## 💡 Project Insights

- **Maharashtra** has the highest number of test labs and reported cases.
- **Uttar Pradesh** leads in total Covid-19 tests conducted.
- **CoviShield** is the most widely administered vaccine.
- Majority of cases fall within the **20–39 age group**.
- **Male** patients account for over **66%** of reported cases.


## 🧾 Final Conclusion

- The Covid-19 in India Dashboard demonstrates the power of **data storytelling using Tableau**.  
- It provides a comprehensive overview of the pandemic's effect on India, using demographic and regional insights, and emphasizes vaccination, testing, and disease progression trends.
- This project is a great example of how data visualization can drive awareness and help monitor public health challenges.
